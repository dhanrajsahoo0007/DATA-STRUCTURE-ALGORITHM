Problem: Meeting Schedule II

    Given an array of meeting time interval objects consisting of start and end times 
    [[start_1,end_1],[start_2,end_2],...] (start_i < end_i), find the minimum number of days 
    required to schedule all meetings without any conflicts.

Example 1:
    Input: intervals = [(0,40),(5,10),(15,20)]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: day1: (0,40) day2: (5,10),(15,20)

Example 2:
    Input: intervals = [(4,9)]
    Output: 1

Note:
    * (0,8),(8,10) is not considered a conflict at 8

Constraints:
    * 0 <= intervals.length <= 500
    * 0 <= intervals[i].start < intervals[i].end <= 1,000,000

Approach:
    1. Sort the intervals based on start time.
    2. Use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of end times of ongoing meetings.
    3. Iterate through the sorted intervals:
        - Remove all meetings that have ended (end time <= current start time)
        - Add the current meeting to the heap
        - Update the maximum number of concurrent meetings if necessary
    4. The maximum number of concurrent meetings at any point is the minimum number of days required.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting and heap operations, where n is the number of intervals.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the heap in the worst case.

"""
Explanation:
    1. Sort start and end times separately.
    2. Use two pointers (s and e) to iterate through start and end times.
    3. If a meeting starts before the earliest ending, increment count (room needed).
    4. If a meeting ends, decrement count (room freed).
    5. Keep track of the maximum count (res) at any point.
    6. The final res is the minimum number of rooms required.

Space Complexity: O(n) for storing sorted arrays
