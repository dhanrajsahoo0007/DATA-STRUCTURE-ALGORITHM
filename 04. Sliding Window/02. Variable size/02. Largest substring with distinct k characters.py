"""
Problem Statement:
Given a string and an integer K, find the length of the longest substring that contains exactly K unique characters.

Explanation:
We use a variable size sliding window technique with a dictionary to keep track of character frequencies:
    1. Use two pointers, i and j, to define the window.
    2. Use a dictionary to store the frequency of characters in the current window.
    3. Maintain a count of unique characters in the current window.
    4. Expand the window by moving j to the right, updating the character count and unique character count.
    5. If unique character count exceeds K, shrink the window from the left until we again have K unique characters.
    6. Update the maximum length whenever we have exactly K unique characters.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
Space Complexity: O(K), where K is the number of unique characters we're looking for.
