Problem Statement:
    Given an array of integers and a target sum K, find the length of the largest subarray 
    with sum of the elements equal to the given value K.

Explanation:
We use a modified sliding window technique with an initial check before shrinking:
    1. Initialize two pointers, i and j, both at the start of the array.
    2. Maintain a running sum (window_sum) of the elements in the current window.
    3. Expand the window by moving j to the right and adding elements to window_sum.
    4. If window_sum exceeds K, first check if i <= j, then enter a loop to shrink the window.
    5. If window_sum equals K, update the max_length.

Note: This approach works for arrays with positive numbers. For arrays with negative 
numbers, a more complex approach using a hash map would be more efficient.

Space Complexity: O(1),

Problem Statement:
    Given an array of integers (including negative numbers) and a target sum K, 
    find the length of the largest subarray with sum of the elements equal to the given value K.

Explanation:
We use a prefix sum approach with a hash map:
    1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the cumulative sum.
    2. Use a hash map to store the first occurrence of each cumulative sum.
    3. Iterate through the array:
    - Update the cumulative sum.
    - If the current sum equals K, update the max length.
    - If (current sum - K) exists in the hash map, update the max length.
    - Store the current sum in the hash map if it's not already there.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case
