"""
Problem Statement:
    Given a word and a text, return the count of occurrences of anagrams of the word in the text.
    An anagram of a word is a rearrangement of its letters to form a new word.

Explanation:
    1. Create a frequency map of characters in the pattern.
    2. Use a count variable to track distinct characters in the pattern.
    3. Slide the window through the text:
        - Decrement frequency for characters in the window.
        - When a character's frequency becomes 0, decrement count.
        - If count becomes 0, we've found an anagram.
        - Slide the window and adjust the frequency map and count.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the text.
Space Complexity: O(k), where k is the number of unique characters in the pattern.
