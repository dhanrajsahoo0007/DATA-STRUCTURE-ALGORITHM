"""
Problem Statement:
    Given an array of integers arr and an integer k, find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size k.
Explanation:
    1. Initialize two pointers, i and j, both at the start of the array.
    2. Use a variable window_max to keep track of the maximum in the current window.
    3. Slide the window through the array:
        - Expand the window by moving j to the right and updating window_max.
        - If the window size equals k, add window_max to the result and slide the window.
        - If the element leaving the window was the max, recalculate window_max.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n-k+1) for the result list, which is O(n) in the worst case when k is small.
