"""
Binary Search Tree (BST) Deletion Implementation

Problem Statement:
Implement a function to delete a given element from a Binary Search Tree.

Time Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree.
- In a balanced BST, h = log(n), where n is the number of nodes.
- In the worst case (skewed tree), h = n.

Space Complexity: O(h) due to the recursive call stack.

Explanation:
The deletion algorithm needs to handle three main cases:
1. Node to be deleted is a leaf (has no children).
2. Node to be deleted has only one child.
3. Node to be deleted has two children.

For case 3, we find the inorder successor (smallest value in the right subtree)
to replace the node we're deleting.
