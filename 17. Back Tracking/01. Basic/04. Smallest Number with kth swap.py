Problem Statement:
    Given a number n and a value k, find the smallest number that can be formed by 
    performing at most k swaps on the digits of n.

Explanation:

Backtracking Approach:
    The backtracking approach tries all possible swaps recursively.
    It starts from the leftmost position and finds the minimum digit from that position to the end.
    If the current digit is not the minimum, it swaps with the rightmost occurrence of the minimum digit.
    This process is repeated for the next position with the remaining swaps.

Recursion Tree for Backtracking (simplified for num = 324 and k = 2):

                   324
                  /   \
               234    324
              /  \    /  \
            234  243 314 324

Note: The actual recursion tree would be much larger for the given example (7654321, k=4).
This simplified tree shows the basic structure of the recursion.


Here's a brief overview of the two approaches:

Backtracking Solution:

    Time Complexity: O(n^k) in the worst case
    Space Complexity: O(n)
    Approach: Recursively tries all possible swaps, starting from the leftmost position and finding the minimum digit from that position to the end.
