    Problem Statement:
        Given a string of length n, generate all possible permutations of its characters.
        A permutation is an arrangement of all the characters in different orders.

        For example, given the string "abc", the permutations are:
        ["abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"]

    Approach:

        We use a backtracking algorithm to generate all permutations:
        1. Start with the entire string.
        2. For each position from left to right:
        a. Swap the character at the current position with each character to its right (including itself).
        b. Recursively generate permutations for the rest of the string.
        c. Backtrack by undoing the swap.
        3. When we reach the end of the string, we've generated a complete permutation.

    Time Complexity: O(n * n!)
        - We generate n! permutations (n choices for first position, n-1 for second, etc.)
        - Each permutation takes O(n) time to construct

    Space Complexity: O(n * n!)
        - We store n! permutations
        - Each permutation is of length n
        - The recursion stack can go up to depth n

    Recursive Tree for input "abc":

                        abc
                    /   |   \
                    abc  bac  cba
                /  \  /  \  /  \
                abc acb bac bca cba cab

    Explanation of the Recursive Tree:
        - Root: The initial string "abc"
        - Level 1: Represents choices for the first position
            - abc: 'a' stays in place
            - bac: 'b' is swapped to first position
            - cba: 'c' is swapped to first position
        - Level 2: Represents choices for the second position
            - For "abc": 'b' stays, or 'c' is swapped
            - For "bac": 'a' stays, or 'c' is swapped
            - For "cba": 'b' stays, or 'a' is swapped
        - Level 3 (Leaves): Final permutations

    Key Points:
    1. Each level in the tree represents fixing a character at a specific position.
    2. Branches represent different choices for each position.
    3. The number of branches decreases by 1 at each level.
    4. Leaf nodes (bottom level) represent complete permutations.
    5. The depth of the tree is equal to the length of the string.
    6. Total number of leaf nodes = n! (all possible permutations)

    Backtracking Process:
    - Moving down the tree: Making a choice (swapping characters)
    - Moving up the tree: Undoing a choice (backtracking)
    - This process ensures we explore all possible combinations efficiently.

    Code Implementation:
