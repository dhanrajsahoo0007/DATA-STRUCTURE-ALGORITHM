Problem Statement:
Given an m x n board of characters and a list of strings words, return all words on the board.
Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells 
are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

Time Complexity: O(M * N * 4^L), where M and N are the dimensions of the board, and L is the maximum length of words.
Space Complexity: O(K), where K is the total number of characters in all words.

Approach:
1. Build a Trie (prefix tree) from the given words for efficient prefix matching.
2. Perform DFS on the board, simultaneously traversing the Trie.
3. When a word is found, add it to the result set.
4. Use a set to store results to automatically handle duplicates.

Examples:
1. Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
   Output: ["eat","oath"]

2. Input: board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]], words = ["abcb"]
   Output: []
