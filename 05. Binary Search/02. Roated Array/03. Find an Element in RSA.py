Problem Statement:
    Given a sorted array of n elements, which is rotated at some unknown pivot, and a target element.
    The task is to find the index of the target element in the array. If the element is not present, return -1.

For example:
    Input: arr = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], target = 0
    Output: 4
    The array was originally sorted in ascending order and then rotated. We need to find the target
    element 0, which is at index 4 in this rotated array.

APPRACH - 1
=============
Based on the previous problem of finding how many times the array is roated 

Explanation:
This problem can be solved efficiently using a two-step approach:

1. Find the rotation point:
   - First, we find the number of times the array has been rotated.
   - This is equivalent to finding the index of the smallest element in the rotated array.
   - We use a modified binary search to find this rotation point in O(log n) time.

2. Perform binary search:
   - Once we know the rotation point, we can treat the array as two sorted subarrays.
   - We perform binary search on both subarrays to find the target element.
   - If the element is found in either subarray, we return its index.
   - If not found in both subarrays, we return -1.


Time Complexity Analysis:
    - find_rotation_count: O(log n)
    - binary_search: O(log n)
    - search_rotated_array: O(log n) + O(log n) = O(log n)

    The overall time complexity is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
    We perform at most two binary searches, but this still results in logarithmic time complexity.

Space Complexity Analysis:
    The space complexity is O(1)

APPROACH - 2 
=============

Explanation:
    This algorithm uses a modified binary search to find the target element in a rotated sorted array.
    In each iteration, we determine which half of the array is sorted and then check if the target
    lies within the sorted half. If it does, we search that half; otherwise, we search the other half.

    1. Calculate the middle index.
    2. If the middle element is the target, return its index.
    3. Check which half of the array is sorted:
    - If the left half is sorted, check if the target is in this range. If yes, search left; otherwise, search right.
    - If the right half is sorted, check if the target is in this range. If yes, search right; otherwise, search left.
    4. Repeat until the element is found or the search space is exhausted.

Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
This is because we're using a binary search approach, halving the search space in each iteration.

Space Complexity: O(1), as we're only using a constant amount of extra space
regardless of the input size.
