"""
Explanation:
    1. This algorithm uses a modified binary search to find the number of rotations.
    2. The number of rotations is equal to the index of the smallest element in the rotated array.
    3. We compare the middle element with its next and previous elements to check if it's the smallest.
    4. If not, we decide which half of the array to search next based on the sorted half.
    
next = (mid + 1) % n:

    This calculates the index of the element immediately after the middle element.
    The modulo operation % n ensures that if mid + 1 exceeds the array length, it wraps around to the beginning of the array.
    For example, if mid is the last index of the array, next will be 0 (the first index).


prevd = (mid - 1 + n) % n:

    This calculates the index of the element immediately before the middle element.
    We add n before the modulo operation to handle the case when mid is 0.
    If mid is 0, mid - 1 would be -1, but -1 + n ensures we get the last element of the array.
    The modulo operation % n then ensures we stay within the array bounds.

Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
This is because we're using a binary search approach, halving the search space in each iteration.

Space Complexity: O(1), as we're only using a constant amount of extra space
regardless of the input size.
