Problem Statement: Find Position of an Element in an Infinite Sorted Array
                Given an infinite sorted array (or an array with unknown size) and a target element, 
                find the index of the target element in the array. If the element is not present, return -1.

Examples:

1. Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...], target = 5
   Output: 4
   Explanation: The element 5 is at index 4.

2. Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, ...], target = 9
   Output: 5
   Explanation: The element 9 is at index 5.

3. Input: arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, ...], target = 8
   Output: -1
   Explanation: The element 8 is not in the array.

Explanation of the approach:

    1. Exponential Search:
    - We start with a small range (box) and exponentially increase its size.
    - This allows us to quickly find a range that potentially contains the target.

    2. Binary Search:
    - Once we have a range, we perform a standard binary search within this range.

    3. Handling "Infinite" Array:
    - We use len(arr) in our implementation to avoid index out of range errors.
    - In a truly infinite array scenario, you would replace len(arr) checks with a method to test if an index is valid.
