Problem Statement: Index of First 1 in a Binary Sorted Infinite Array

Given an infinite sorted binary array (containing only 0s and 1s), find the index of the first 1 in the array.
The array is infinite, which means you don't know the size of the array beforehand.

Examples:

1. Input: arr = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...]
   Output: 5
   Explanation: The first 1 appears at index 5.

2. Input: arr = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...]
   Output: 2
   Explanation: The first 1 appears at index 2.

3. Input: arr = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...]
   Output: 0
   Explanation: The array starts with 1, so the first 1 is at index 0.

The approach uses a combination of exponential search to find a range and then binary search to find the first 1 within that range.
Explanation of the approach:

    1. Exponential Search:
    - We start with a small range and exponentially increase its size.
    - This allows us to quickly find a range that contains the first 1.

    2. Binary Search for First Occurrence:
    - Once we have a range, we perform a modified binary search to find the first occurrence of 1.
    - When we find a 1, we continue searching in the left half to find the first occurrence.

    3. Handling "Infinite" Array:
    - We use len(arr) in our implementation to avoid index out of range errors.
    - In a truly infinite array scenario, you would replace len(arr) checks with a method to test if an index is valid.
