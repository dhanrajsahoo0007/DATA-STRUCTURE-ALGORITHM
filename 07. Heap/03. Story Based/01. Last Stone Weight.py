# Last Stone Weight

# You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.
# We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:
# * If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
# * If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
# At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.
# Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.
 
# Example 1:
    # Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: 
    # We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
    # we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
    # we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
    # we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value o



# Solution:
#     Step- 1: We create a max heap by negating all values in the stones list. Python's heapq module implements a min heap, so we use negative values to simulate a max heap.
#     Step- 2: We enter a loop that continues while there are at least two stones in the heap:
#     Step- 3: We pop the two heaviest stones (remembering to negate them back to positive values).
            #   If the stones have different weights, we calculate the difference and push it back onto the heap (as a negative value).
#     Step- 4: After the loop ends, we check if there's a stone left in the heap:    
#     Step- 5: If there is, we return its weight (negating it back to positive).
            #  If the heap is empty, we return 0.    


# Time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of stones. 
    # Each heap operation (push or pop) takes O(log n) time, and in the worst case, we might need to do this for all n stones.

# Space complexity is O(n) for the heap.

def lastStoneWeight(stones):
    # Convert to max heap by negating values
    max_heap = [-s for s in stones]
    heapq.heapify(max_heap)
    
    while len(max_heap) > 1:
        # Get the two heaviest stones
        y = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        x = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        
        # Smash the stones
        if x != y:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -(y - x))
    
    # Return the last stone weight or 0 if no stones left
    return -max_heap[0] if max_heap else 0
