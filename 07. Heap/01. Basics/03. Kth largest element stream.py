# Problem Statement:

# Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

# Implement the KthLargest class:
    # KthLargest(int k, int[] nums): Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of integers nums.
    # int add(int val): Appends the integer val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.



import heapq

class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: list[int]):
        self.k = k
        self.heap = []
        
        # Initialize the heap with the first k elements
        for num in nums:
            self.add(num)

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        if len(self.heap) < self.k:
            heapq.heappush(self.heap, val)
        elif val > self.heap[0]:
            heapq.heapreplace(self.heap, val)
        
        return self.heap[0]


# Explanation:

#     Step-1 : We use a min-heap to keep track of the k largest elements.
#     Step-2 : In the constructor, we initialize the heap with the first k elements from nums.
#     Step-3 : In the add method:
    #     If the heap size is less than k, we simply add the new value.
    #     If the heap is full and the new value is larger than the smallest in the heap, we replace the smallest with the new value.
    #     We always return the smallest value in the heap, which is the kth largest overall.

# Time Complexity:
#     Constructor: O(n log k), where n is the length of nums
#     add method: O(log k)
# Space Complexity:
#     O(k) to store the heap

# Input
# ["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
# [[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]
# Output
# [null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]
# Explanation
kthLargest = KthLargest(3, [4, 5, 8, 2]);
print(kthLargest.add(3))   # Output: 4
print(kthLargest.add(5))   # Output: 5
print(kthLargest.add(10))  # Output: 5
print(kthLargest.add(9))   # Output: 8
print(kthLargest.add(4))
